Everything we could ever need for our webiste, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte) and using [`flowbite`](https://flowbite-svelte.com/pages/getting-started) for UI components.


## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install` (or `npm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of this app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

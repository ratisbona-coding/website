			Ratisbona Coding and Hackaburg stands for inclusivity. We believe that every single person has
			the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment.
		</p>
		<p>
			Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to
			gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
			social class, economic status, veteran status. Additional cases of harassment include but not
			limited to sharing sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, brigading,
			doxxing, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
			inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what youâ€™re doing is making
			someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.
		</p>
		<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
		<p>
			Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, Ratisbona Coding and Hackaburg staff, and
			anyone else participating in the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
			particular, attendees should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material both in
			their hacks and during the event. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised
			clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
		</p>
		<p>
			If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Ratisbona Coding and Hackaburg may take any
			action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with
			no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
			concerns, please contact Ratisbona Coding and Hackaburg using the reporting procedures defined
			below.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ratisbona Coding and Hackaburg representatives can help participants contact campus security
			or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment
			to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
		</p>
		<p>
			We expect participants to follow these rules at all hackathon venues, online interactions in
			relation to the event, hackathon-related social events, and on hackathon supplied
			transportation.
